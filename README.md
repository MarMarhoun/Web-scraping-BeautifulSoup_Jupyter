# Web scraping using BeautifulSoup


In this project, I extracted data from multiple pages of a car dealer website using BeautifulSoup.

Because, we often rely on datasets from someone else. This notebook should show you how to scrape and store data in Excel/CSV Files. By using the pipeline of this notebook you will be able to scrape your own data and create your own dataset.

> The requirement is basic knowledge of Python Programming.
