# Web scraping using BeautifulSoup


In this project, I extracted data from multiple pages of a car dealer website using BeautifulSoup.

Especially for people who work with data, it is important to be able to create your own datasets. Because, we often rely on datasets from someone else. This course should show all data enthusiasts how to scrape and store data in Excel/CSV Files. By using the pipeline of this notebook you will be able to scrape your own data and create your own dataset.

> The requirement for this course is basic knowledge of Python Programming.
